## Now I am working on:

### üå± Sprout
**Sprout** is a comprehensive tool for plant care, designed to provide users with detailed information about specific plants. It offers advice on care, growth, and essential plant data. Alongside informative blog articles covering plant care, gardening tips, and current trends, the app incorporates gamification elements, allowing users to earn badges, points, and set goals. By taking a brief quiz, users receive personalized plant recommendations tailored to their lifestyle, environment, and preferences. The app's management feature sends reminders for watering, fertilizing, and repotting plants. Users can organize their plants by assigning them to specific rooms in their homes, fostering a more personal bond between caregiver and plant.

### üëæ Pokemon Adventure Game
The project utilized Pok√©Api to access Pok√©mon data, creating an immersive gaming experience. Users could interactively engage with Pok√©mon encounters, select their Pok√©mon for battles, and capture encountered Pok√©mon. Through this project, I honed skills in handling API requests, implementing game mechanics, and integrating real-time data, showcasing a passion for immersive web experiences and gaming functionalities.
